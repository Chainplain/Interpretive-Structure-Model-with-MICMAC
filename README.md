# Interpretive-Structure-Model-with-MICMAC
Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) is a method of analyzing complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, 
more manageable components. 
It is used to identify the relationships between these components and to create a hierarchy that shows how they are interconnected. 
This method is commonly used in fields such as management, engineering, 
and social sciences to understand complex systems and to create effective strategies for managing them. The ISM process involves several steps, 
including identifying the components of the system, creating a matrix of relationships between these components, 
and using this matrix to create a hierarchy of the system. 
The resulting hierarchy can help stakeholders to understand the relationships between different components of the system and to identify areas 
where changes or improvements can be made.

## How to use
- Please provide me an initial reach map matrix, filling 2->N rols and cols, see the example test.xlsx.

- run the main.py, we need the following packages: numpy, networkx, time, matplotlib, sklearn

- Following the instructions to input the .xlsx name where your matrix locates, and the cluster kernel number you want in the MICMAC, which will be marked in different colors

- then the results are two pics, and a txt file recording results.
